= GemHelper

A lightweight shim for requiring gems based on the geminstaller.yml file. For rails it hooks into the initializer via GemHelper.load. For a sinatra or other app it does a simple gem blah then requires.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
